# Dictionary Website
This is a web-based dictionary website created using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The website fetches data from a third-party API to provide users with definitions, synonyms, and other information about words.

## Features
Word Search: Users can enter a word into the search bar and receive the definition, synonyms, and other information about the word.

## Recent Searches: 
The website keeps track of the 10 most recent word searches, allowing users to easily revisit previous searches.


## Getting Started
To use the dictionary website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser.
